# 🇮🇳 Indian Constitution Awareness Portal

## 🚀 Overview
The Indian Constitution Awareness Portal is a web-based platform developed during a Frontend Development Frameworks Hackathon to promote awareness, understanding, and engagement with the Indian Constitution. The portal provides role-based access to citizens, students, educators, legal experts, and administrators, ensuring tailored content and responsibilities for each user type.
