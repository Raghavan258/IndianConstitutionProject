  The Constitution of India is the supreme law of the country. It lays down how the Union and the States are organised, defines the powers of each organ of government, and protects the basic rights and freedoms of people living in India.[web:511][web:609]

  The Preamble to the Constitution captures its guiding vision. It describes India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic and aims to secure justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity for all citizens, while preserving the unity and integrity of the nation.[web:600][web:603][web:605]

  A central part of the Constitution is the chapter on Fundamental Rights, which guarantees equality before the law, freedoms such as speech and movement, protection of life and personal liberty, and safeguards for culture and education. Alongside these, Fundamental Duties remind every citizen to respect the Constitution, promote harmony, protect public property, and preserve the environment.[web:604][web:606][web:610]

  Dr B. R. Ambedkar, as Chairman of the Drafting Committee, played a crucial role in shaping the Constitution. He worked to ensure that the document combats social injustice, abolishes untouchability, and provides safeguards and opportunities for historically disadvantaged communities, making the Constitution both a legal framework and a tool for social transformation.[web:520][web:514][web:611]
